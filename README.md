## Challenge 02 - React Components
<br/>
The challenge was to break the application contained in App.tsx into small components

<ul>
   <li>Cut code from the App component to paste it into another component and make the proper tweakings</li>
   <li>Connect the given interfaces to the new components to eradicate the errors</li>
   <li>Analyze which parts of code and data needed to be passed to the other components and make it work</li>
</ul>

This is what it looks like:
